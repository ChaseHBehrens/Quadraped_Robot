# Advantages
Solenoids are very simplistic and can be integrated directly into a leg assembly. One major advantage is that solenoids function almost as electromagnetic springs. This would allow for smooth dynamic movement and less mechanical strain on parts. Additionally physical springs extending the solenoids would allow the robot to maintain an upright position without requiring power.
# Shortcomings
I was unable to get the compressive force needed from the solenoid. Originally I planned on upgrading the basic solenoid to a linear motor or voice coil actuator for more precise control. However I discovered a major issue with this design. Large actuators placed on the moving leg increase angular momentum. This is seen in biology animals like horses have the largest part of the muscle higher on the leg to avoid wasting energy. 
# Future plans
I am considering a method of actuating the leg via pulleys. This would allow all actuators to be placed in the main body of the robot.
